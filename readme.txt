Enables users of your WooCommerce site to take Bitcoin Private payments when checking out.

== Description ==

Allows users to take Bitcoin Private payments when checking out in a WooCommerce site.

Install then activate the plugin and it'll take you to the settings page, asking you to copy your widget code from your account on the btcppay.com site into the textarea shown.

After pasting in your widget code and hitting submit, you're done - your users can then pay for their orders with Bitcoin Private!

= Dynamically handled cart value =

Note that the within widget code you paste, there will be a 'static' value for currency, eg "currency" : 0.1,

There is no need to adjust the widget code at all, this currency line is automatically replaced with the users cart total on the fly, so no need to fiddle with config here.
